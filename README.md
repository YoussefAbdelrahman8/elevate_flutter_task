~~# Elevate Flutter Task

This project is a Flutter-based mobile application that displays a product catalog, where users can search for products
and view them in a grid format. It utilizes state management with the `Bloc` pattern and integrates a custom `AppBar`,
caching for network images, and error handling with Flutter Toast notifications.

## Features

- **Product Catalog**: Displays a list of products fetched from an API or local source.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for products by name.
- **Custom AppBar**: Includes a branded logo, a search bar, and a shopping cart icon.
- **State Management**: Uses `Flutter Bloc` for managing app states (loading, success, error).
- **Network Image Caching**: Uses the `cached_network_image` package to cache product images and improve performance.
- **Error Handling**: Shows error messages using `Fluttertoast` in case of network issues or data retrieval errors.
- **MVVM pattern**
- **Repository pattern**
- **DI (injectable-get it)**
